Attempting to expand on the original concept that Jason had with his jukebox/sound board to add more functionality.

1. Add ability to run both songs, effects, and ambience noises at the same time - accomplished
2. Add ability to control volume level of each player individually - accomplished
3. Add ability to loop individual song, effect, or ambient noise - working on / help needed (believe I need to move the media players to 
  individual jobs.)
4. more to come...
